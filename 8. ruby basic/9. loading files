load 每次使用会重新加载外部文件一次，需要加上文件的扩展名
require和require_relative仅加载外部文件一次
require './文件'相当于require_relative'文件'，默认文件扩展名为.rb 

Note: 
Ruby programmers nearly always use require or require_relative
rather than load. The effects of load are useful only if the code in the external file
has changed or if it contains active code that will be executed immediately.
